3. Linear Regression Residuals (CAPM-style)
   You can regress the stock's returns on the index:

Stock_Return(t) = α + β \* Index_Return(t) + ε(t)
Then use the residual ε(t) as your signal. This residual represents the movement not explained by the index.

Step-by-Step: CAPM Residuals

1. Fit a linear regression
   We regress the stock return on the NIFTY return:

Stock𝑡= 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ NIFTY 𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑡 Stock t ​ =α+β⋅NIFTY t ​ +ε t ​

Using Python or Excel, you’ll find:

β ≈ 0.9 (the stock closely tracks the index)

α ≈ 0.1 (small constant offset)

2. Predict the expected stock return from NIFTY
   Predicted𝑡=0.1+0.9⋅NIFTY𝑡
   Predictedt=0.1+0.9⋅NIFTYYt
   ​

3. Compute residuals 𝜀 𝑡 = Actual𝑡 − Predicted 𝑡
   ε t ​ =Actual t ​ −Predicted t ​

Let’s calculate this:

Day NIFTY Actual Stock Predicted Stock (0.1 + 0.9×NIFTY) Residual (ε)
1 1.0 1.2 1.0 0.2
2 2.0 1.8 1.9 -0.1
3 -1.0 -0.5 -0.8 0.3
4 1.0 0.7 1.0 -0.3
5 -0.5 -1.0 -0.35 -0.65

✅ What You Get: Residuals (ε)
These residuals show the part of the stock’s return that isn’t explained by the index.

Positive ε means stock outperformed the index.

Negative ε means underperformed the index.

You can now use ε as:

New features for training

Or to label your data (e.g., "Did the stock outperform index in 30 days?")

🧠 Why It’s Powerful
This isolates stock-specific behavior — the idiosyncratic signals your model can actually learn from.

Great — let’s walk through how you can get α and β (intercept and slope) using real stock and index return data in Python.

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Get α and β (Using Python)
🔧 What You Need
Daily returns of:

A stock (e.g., TCS)

The index (e.g., NIFTY 50)

Python tools: yfinance, pandas, sklearn

✅ 1. Install Required Packages (if not already)
pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas
✅ 2. Example Code to Get α and β
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Download data for stock and index (adjust tickers for your use case)

stock = yf.download("TCS.NS", start="2023-01-01", end="2024-01-01")
index = yf.download("^NSEI", start="2023-01-01", end="2024-01-01") # NIFTY 50 Index

# Use Adjusted Close prices

stock_returns = stock['Adj Close'].pct_change().dropna()
index_returns = index['Adj Close'].pct_change().dropna()

# Align both series by date

data = pd.concat([stock_returns, index_returns], axis=1)
data.columns = ['stock', 'index']
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Fit linear regression

X = data['index'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y = data['stock'].values
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Get α and β

alpha = model.intercept*
beta = model.coef*[0]

print(f"α (intercept): {alpha:.4f}")
print(f"β (slope): {beta:.4f}")
📊 Sample Output
(Your actual output will vary by dates and stocks chosen)

α (intercept): 0.0002
β (slope): 0.89
✅ What These Mean
β (slope): How much the stock moves when the index moves. If β ≈ 1, it moves in sync with the index.

α (intercept): The stock’s average return when the index return is zero (its "alpha").
